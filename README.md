# Reversi-C
by Rafael de Moura Moreira - rafaelmmoreira@gmail.com - https://github.com/rafaelmmoreira

A C implementation of Reversi made as a college assignment back in 2009.

It's a sort of relic for me and I do not intend to update it, fix bugs or translate its comments. 

But feel free to use it and modify it as you please.

It needs conio to compile.

A Python version with GUI made using tkinter is also available: https://github.com/rafaelmmoreira/PyReversiTK/
